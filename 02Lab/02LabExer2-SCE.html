			<h2 class="subhead txtjustify"> [KNOW]&nbsp; What do you <i>know</i> about HTML before taking this course? </h2>
				<p class="text txtjustify"> — Due to the influence of my father who teaches programming and other related subjects, growing up, I'd always see him coding, which gave me a leeway to familiarize myself with some of his lessons. HTML was included in those lessons and so that's why I knew the <b>basics</b> of it: <i>what it stands for, basic elements, tags and attributes, how to create and code in HTML, and the document structure</i> of HTML. These topics have also been discussed this quarter, which gave me time to assess my understanding and proficiency in HTML. </p>

			<div class="box2">
				<h2 class="subhead txtjustify"> [WONDER]&nbsp; What do you <i>want</i> to know about HTML? </h2>
				<p class="text txtjustify"> — I wanted to know about <b>HTML5</b> because i can't recall it being included in my informal discussion with my father back then or at least it wasn't defined or discussed by him all that much. While I cannot come up with anything specific to learn about it specifically, <i>I'm generally interested in everything this scripting language has to offer.</i> </p>
			</div>

			<div class="box2">
				<h2 class="subhead txtjustify"> [LEARNED]&nbsp; What have you <i>learned</i> about HTML so far? </h2>
				<p class="text txtjustify"> — As I said, <i>I've relearned the basics</i> and to add onto that I've also learned what I wanted to learn, <b>HTML5,</b> or at the very least, I am now introduced to the new elements, tags, web forms, and content models. In conclusion, I look forward to another quarter of learning HTML and its intricacies alongside CSS for our Computer Programming 2. </p>
